In exceptional cased, the Equivalence Committee may, on recommendation of concerned Dean, consider extending the credits up to 40 percent.<br/>For transfer of grade of a course, a student must have at least B grade in the course. In some cases, courses with C+ grades as per Eastern University standard may be considered for transfer or exemption. For the purpose of transferring credits, the Equivalence Committee of the University determines equivalence of courses and grades for each transfer student. The curriculum, evaluation system and grading standard of the university from which the student is transferring must be comparable to that Eastern University which reserves the right to make final decision on transfer. Incase of any course transfer against 2 or more courses, the average grade will be shown in the EU transcript. GED/ Foundation courses will only be exempted instead of transfer.",
